The environment variable LINEDIT can be set to control the behavior of
linedit. The value can contain as substring (no spaces are allowed around =):

   gui=no	do not lauch the GUI console (Win32 specific)
   ansi=no	do not use ANSI ESC sequences (to move cursor, ...)
   out=FD	write output chars to the FD file descriptor (for echo, ...)
   out=FILE     write output to the file FILE (for echo, ...)

e.g.
export LINEDIT='out=/dev/..., ansi=no'

NB: to run test_linedit, the PATH should contain ../W32GUICons since
the dll is there, (use ../SETVARS)

VCTestLinedit contains a MSVC project to compile both test_linedit and 
the dll

LccTestLinedit contains a LCC project to compile test_linedit under wedit
